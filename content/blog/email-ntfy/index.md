In this blog post, we'll walk through the process of building a Cloudflare Worker that forwards emails as notifications to ntfy.sh. This project leverages Cloudflare's powerful serverless platform to handle email routing and forwarding seamlessly.

## What is ntfy.sh?

[ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) is a simple, free, and open-source service for sending notifications. It allows you to send notifications to your devices via HTTP, making it easy to integrate with various services and applications. With ntfy.sh, you can receive notifications on your phone, desktop, or any other device that supports HTTP. ntfy.sh supports [email publishing](https://docs.ntfy.sh/publish/#e-mail-publishing), however, I wanted something for a self hosted ntfy.sh service.

Here's an example of a simple cron job that alerts the user when disk space on the root disk is running low. This demonstrates how ntfy.sh can be used to send instant notifications for critical system alerts, similar to how email alerts can be forwarded as push notifications using Cloudflare Workers.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mingigs=10
avail=$(df | awk '$6 == "/" && $4 < '$mingigs' * 1024*1024 { print $4/1024/1024 }')
topicurl=https://ntfy.sh/mytopic

if [ -n "$avail" ]; then
  curl \
    -d "Only $avail GB available on the root disk. Better clean that up." \
    -H "Title: Low disk space alert on $(hostname)" \
    -H "Priority: high" \
    -H "Tags: warning,cd" \
    $topicurl
fi
```

## What is an Email Worker?

With Email Workers, you can leverage the power of Cloudflare Workers to process your emails and create custom workflows. These workflows allow for email forwarding, spam filtering, or triggering notifications based on incoming messages.

Here is an example of an Email Worker:

```javascript
export default {
  async email(message, env, ctx) {
    const allowList = ["friend@example.com", "coworker@example.com"];
    if (allowList.indexOf(message.from) == -1) {
      message.setReject("Address not allowed");
    } else {
      await message.forward("inbox@corp");
    }
  }
}
```

## Setting Up the Project

You can use this project as is, after updating the values in `wrangler.jsonc` and creating the Cloudflare secrets for ntfy. You are also welcome to modify the project to your needs and test your changes by running `yarn test` and creating the Cloudflare secrets for ntfy.

### Step 1: Clone the Example Project

First, clone the example project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharjeelaziz/email-ntfy.git
cd email-ntfy
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Next, install the necessary dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Update Configuration

Update `forwarding_address`. This address must be verified. You can add and verify this address on the *Destination addresses* tab.

```json
{
  "name": "email-ntfy",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "compatibility_date": "2024-01-05",
  "observability": {
    "enabled": true,
    "head_sampling_rate": 1
  },
  "vars": {
    "forwarding_address": "catch-all@example.com",
    "allowed_senders": ["sa@example.com", "alarms@example.com"],
    "allowed_domains": ["example.com"],
    "tz": "US/Eastern"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Deploy the Worker

Deploying the worker is straightforward with Wrangler. Run the following command to deploy your Cloudflare Worker:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

### Step 5: Configure Secrets

Next, you'll need to configure your secrets for the ntfy.sh service. If using a self-hosted ntfy.sh with authentication, set `NTFY_TOKEN`. Otherwise, you can use a dummy value or modify the code to remove the token-related code.

```bash
npx wrangler secret put NTFY_TOKEN
npx wrangler secret put NTFY_TOPIC
```

Once entered, you'll receive a confirmation message:

```console
âœ” Enter a secret value: â€¦ *************************
ðŸŒ€ Creating the secret for the Worker "email-ntfy"
âœ¨ Success! Uploaded secret NTFY_TOPIC
```

### Step 6: Set Up Email Routing

To enable and add your first Email Worker, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and domain.
2. Navigate to **Email > Email Routing > Email Workers**.
3. If the deployment was successful, you should see `email-ntfy` as one of the available workers. Select **Create route** to create an email for your domain that routes to this worker.
4. Note: You must create a new route to use with the Email Worker you created. You can have multiple routes bound to the same Email Worker.

### Step 7: Verify the Setup

Send an email to the registered email address.

You should receive an ntfy notification for the selected topic.

## Tips

- Change the `name` field in `wrangler.jsonc` to deploy a separate worker with a different topic.

## Conclusion

With Cloudflare Workers and ntfy.sh, you can easily set up a reliable email forwarding service that sends notifications to your desired endpoint. This approach ensures real-time email alerts without manually checking your inbox.
